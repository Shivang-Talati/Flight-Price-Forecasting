Advanced Machine Learning Project: Flight Price Prediction

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to estimate flight ticket prices based on various features such as the airline, source, destination, class, and journey details. We aim to leverage different machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and derive insights for airline pricing strategies.
Key Tasks
1.	Feature Engineering
-	Explore the dataset and clean it by checking for missing values, duplicates, and statistical information.
-	Extract key features such as Date, Month, and Year from the Date of Journey column.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-	Identify the most preferred airlines.
-	Determine the most frequent source and destination for flights.
3.	Impact of Independent Features on Target Feature (Price)
-	Find which airline has the highest price.
-	Analyze if business class flights are higher priced, and filter flights priced above 50k.
4.	Feature Encoding
-	Apply encoding techniques to handle categorical variables.
5.	Model Building
-	Train multiple models using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
-	Evaluate model performance.
6.	Model Comparison & Tuning
-	Compare all models and justify the best-performing model.
-	Tune the chosen model using hyperparameter optimization.
7.	Conclusion
-	Provide insights from the business perspective and ensure all preprocessing steps are applied to the test data.
